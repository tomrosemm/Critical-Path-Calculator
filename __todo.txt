TODO:(S) Input validation/cleaning
TODO: See if we can eliminate tasks own name from list of predecessors/successors available to it - maybe a separate function that checks current table row and deletes any matches being populated to it that have the same name as the current task name. If we shove that in the end of the update predecessors successors would that work?
TODO: Boundary times displaying to table
TODO:(T) Quick Info in some sort of recallable and dismissible form on main page, use info button as hover trigger and as link to full help.  Contain quick usage tips for multiple menus and graph viewer, etc
TODO: Populate cards on help page with different topics
TODO: Make relevant info appear on graph with function tied to toggle triggers for on and off
TODO: Replace sample picture for toggle info (currently the green circle)
TODO: See if we can control how zoomed in the window is viewing the output of the graph, and extra if we can tie it to dynamically change appropriate to output graph
TODO: (T) Delete button fill space better
TODO: (T) Look into adjusting the gap between input row cells and the elements within
